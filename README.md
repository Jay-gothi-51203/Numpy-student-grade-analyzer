# NumPy-Based Student Grade Analyzer

This project demonstrates the use of NumPy for efficient data manipulation and basic statistical analysis within the context of student performance evaluation. It reflects core Python skills, NumPy proficiency, and the ability to structure data-centric solutions.

## Objective
To develop a lightweight student grade analysis system that leverages NumPy arrays to store, compute, and extract performance insights from academic data. This includes total scoring, average performance, rank identification, and filtering of high-performing students.

## Key Functionalities
- Efficient storage of student names and subject-wise marks using NumPy arrays
- Calculation of:
  - Total marks obtained by each student
  - Average score across subjects
  - Minimum and maximum marks per student
- Filtering students who scored above 80% (i.e., 240 out of 300)
- Identification of the top-performing student using NumPy's vectorized operations

## Technologies and Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: NumPy
- Development Environment: VS Code / Jupyter Notebook (or any Python IDE)
